Fine-Tune & Evaluate Large Language Models in 2024 with Amazon SageMaker

In 2024, the landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) has evolved significantly, boasting a plethora of competitors such as Meta AI's Llama 2, Mistrals Mistral & Mixtral models, TII Falcon, and more. While these models offer diverse capabilities like chatbots, question answering, and summarization out of the box, fine-tuning them on specific datasets can enhance performance for customized applications. This guide delves into fine-tuning open LLMs from Hugging Face using Amazon SageMaker, providing a tailored approach for seamless deployment and evaluation on SageMaker. 

The process entails:
1. Setting up the development environment
2. Creating and preparing the dataset
3. Fine-tuning the LLM using the trl toolkit on Amazon SageMaker
4. Deploying and evaluating the fine-tuned LLM on Amazon SageMaker
